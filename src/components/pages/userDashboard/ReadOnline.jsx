//           Alesbian artist wants to make the most of her summer in Paris in this
//           belle epoque romance.
//           <br />
//           Manuela del Carmen Caceres Galvan would like to be thoroughly
//           debauched before returning to Venezuela and entering into a loveless
//           marriage for the benefit of her family’s finances. After she bonds
//           with the enticing Duchess of Sundridge, Cora Kempf Bristol, over their
//           mutual appreciation for art, the women come to an agreement.
//           Business-minded Cora wants to buy land owned by Manuela to complete a
//           railroad, and Manuela agrees to sell in exchange for Cora’s
//           introducing her to the parts of Paris where women who like women
//           gather throughout the remainder of her trip. Cora was once involved in
//           a scandal and has no desire to be part of another, so she tries to
//           push aside her desire for vivacious Manuela, but their attraction
//           proves irresistible. As Manuela’s sojourn approaches its end, though,
//           the women realize they don’t want a future without each other. Herrera
//           delivers another sumptuous and historically rich romance, following A
//           Caribbean Heiress in Paris (2022). The queer and Latine characters are
//           lively and bold, and they get to embrace a full, earned
//           happily-ever-after despite all obstacles and detractors. The big
//           emotions, exciting drama, and toe-curling sensuality make for an
//           engrossing tale, but what stands out is the sense of community. This
//           is a riveting story of finding one’s person, but equally important,
//           it’s about finding one’s people—the friends who understand, accept,
//           embrace, and encourage. It’s with that support that these characters
//           are able to be their full, vibrant selves and open themselves up to
//           love and be loved.
//           <br />
//           Empowering and exhilarating.
